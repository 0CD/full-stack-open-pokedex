In a situation where a Java application is begin actively developed by a team of 6 people, key steps in the CI pipeline are linting, testing, and building. For linting, we can use tools like 'Checkstyle' or 'SpotBugs'. Checkstyle is a tool that helps to maintain a coding standard by checking the source code, and SpotBugs is a tool that finds bugs in the source code. For testing, we can use tools like 'JUnit' or 'TestNG'. JUnit is widely used for unit testing, while TestNG has additional features like parallel execution and data-driven testing. For building, we can use tools like 'Maven' or 'Gradle'.

Besides Jenkins and GitHub Actions, alternatives like GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI, Travis CI can be used. GitLab CI/CD is integrated with GitLab, which is a self-hosted solution, and CircleCI and Travis CI are cloud-based solutions.

Choosing between self-hosted and cloud-based environment depends on the team's needs. Self-hosted solutions provide better control over the environment and may be preferred for better compliance and security, but require more resources to maintain and setup. Whereas cloud-based solutions reduce the maintenance burden and provide more flexibility in terms of scaling and cost. The decision should be made based on the project's budget and requirements.
